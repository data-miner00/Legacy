# Legacy

Legacy stuffs.

## Motive

Recently a friend of mine have a question about Asp.Net. I was confident that I can answer her queries but when she presented 'Web Service' to me, I was perplexed as I have never heard such thing before. Feeling defeated, I decided to explore more on the legacy stuffs that .NET Framework offers.

## Technologies

- .NET Framework 4.8
- Web service
- Web forms
- Autofac
- MS Test

## Entry Points

### Legacy.Webforms

The default template generated by Visual Studio for Web Forms.

### Legacy.Webservice

A minimal SOAP application. It contains `UserService` which takes an ID and returns the user found in the `UserRepository`. Additionally, dependency injection was configured using Autofac in an attempt to decouple the service itself.
